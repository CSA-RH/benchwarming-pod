# Pod scaling test

This repository was created with the goal of showcasing some scenarios where we need to have a spare node ready to take on a sudden increase in cluster load, avoiding downtime due to cloud provisioning:

## Assumptions

To demo's sake, we will assume the following:

- Cluster has node autoscaling from 2 to 5 nodes
- Nodes have 12GB of RAM each
- All pods **request** 2GB of RAM

## Setup

Head over to the setup folder and create all the resources in the `.yaml` files.

You should end up with 2 nodes, one filled with 3 high priority pods and the other with a single benchwarming pod.

## Scenario 1: Scaling up, needing a new node

[ðŸ”— Link](./scenario1.md)

4 new high priority pods arrive, and there are not enough resources to accomodate them and the previous 3 high priority pods.
